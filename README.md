This cloud based solution aims to help young learners, particularly during their self-study sessions. While in doubt on a topic of study, the application enables them to  access reliable information. This also enables them to reach out to their favourite teacher for a more detailed answer.Students can publish their queries or respond to queries posted by other students within their study circle. Moreover, an adaptive BOT(IBM Watson Assistant) is always ready to clarify their doubts on-demand. The BOT learns from student-teacher and student-student interactions over the time. Being part of parent-teacher community, parents can also participate in the process as content approver that are filtered for review by the system. Thus, ensuring students always see a moderated content to avoid any distractions due to profanity.

In a nutshell, objective of Project Svādhyāya is to provide a continuous and an uninterrupted learning experience to students by means of a hyper-localized learning system.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Befor the new normal can be baselined, the most recited guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time, ensuring they remain connected with their teachers and have access to source of their knowledge is necessary. Any interruption in learning process makes a learner disapointed. With a need of stay at shelter, it is difficult for the students to meet with their favourite teachers in person. 

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well to ensure contineous learning. Technology can help establish a connection between sutent and teacher on demand. It can also help student access the resources they need instantly.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable students to get their queries clarified by experts which causes a roadblock to their study at home. Most importantly an uninterrupted learning experirnce will help them continue their learning on a dissruptive environment. A teacher best understands its students need. Connecting students with their favourite teacher often helpful during their self-study sessions.

1. The student(user) navigates to website and post their question.
2. Watson Assistant reponds to the questions through its skills
3. Watson Assistant directs the questions to experts(user)
4. Experts(user) communicates to student(user)
